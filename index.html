                <h3>Introduction</h3>
                <p>
                    Tim Berners Lee dreamt of a World Wide Web that would be free and accessible to everyone.
                    Sadly, the modern web is littered with
                    poorly designed websites and difficult to navigate code (for both developers and users). This often
                    comes down to a lack of
                    understanding around different user needs.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Designing pages that are accessible for everyone shouldn't be too difficult. The developers at Tech
                    Returners News have collated an
                    'easy wins' checklist for Web page accessibility.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Keep this guide handy... When creating your own websites you can check these criteria off the list!

                <h3>Accessibility Checks:</h3>
                <p>
                    <strong>Heading elements & Page Titles:</strong> HTML heading elements have been used to represent
                    page structure,
                    supporting assistive
                    technologies that allow page navigation from heading to heading.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Re-size Text:</strong> You can vary text size by using your browser's text resize settings
                    (through Options
                    or
                    Preferences), text-only zoom, page
                    zoom (which also zooms images, buttons etc) without incurring styling issues / text over-lapping or
                    being cut off the page.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Alternative text for images:</strong> All images have been given appropriate alternative
                    text.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Link text:</strong> All hyperlinks should make sense when read out of context, and
                    hyperlinks are clearly
                    presented in a different text style from
                    normal body text. If a link opens in a new browser page, it has been labelled as doing so.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>JavaScript independence:</strong> Where JavaScript or other scripts are used for navigation
                    or functionality,
                    an
                    alternative mechanism has been
                    put in place in case your browser does not support these scripts.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Colour contrast:</strong> has been checked for text and background colour combinations to
                    ensure that the
                    contrast is sufficient and I have also
                    ensured that information is not referenced by colour alone.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Style sheets:</strong> If style sheets are not supported or are turned off, information on
                    the site can still
                    be
                    accessed and read.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Forms:</strong> forms are marked up correctly so people can interact with them using only
                    the keyboard, voice
                    input or screen readers. The form
                    labels themselves are clickable, increasing the target area and making it easier to select small
                    radio
                    buttons of checkboxes.
                </p>

                    By spending just a little more time on getting the building blocks of the web right, developers can
                    help
                    create an Internet that works for everyone.
